# Louise's Kickstarting with Excel Analysis

## Overview of Project
-Based on the Kickstarting data provided, we are running analysis based on how different launch dates affect campaigns and their funding goals.

### Purpose
-To identify for Louise if there are certain launch months that contribute to the success, failure or cancellation of a campaign. view when most campaigns are launch.

-Filtering using only "plays" We are screening the data to see what range of fundraising goals are most likely to succeed, fail or be cancel.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
-looking at the graph analysis the first thing we notice is that “failed,” and “cancel” line never crosses the “successful” line with the month of December being the closest point of the two lines ever touching. This already implies that regardless launch date the chances of success are higher than that of failure. We can also see that most fundraisers are launch between April and August. Reaching the highest point of success in May. Pay attention to how on May both the “successful” line and “failed” line increase, but not at the same rate. While May successes seem to sky rocket the failure seem to increase, but not by much.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-In this analysis we used the following ranges to determine percentage of successful, fail, and cancel campaigns for “plays”:
Goal 

*Less Than 1000
*1000 to 4999
*5000 to 9999
*10000 to 14999
*15000 to 19999
*20000 to 24999
*25000 to 29999
*30000 to 34999
*35000 to 39999
*40000 to 44999
*45000 to 49999
*Greater than 50000

Looking at the graph we start seeing a pattern form in the graph. We can see 3 intersections 
 Each intersection between the “failed” and “successful” lines at the ranges between 15000 to 1999, 34999 to 35000 and 44999 to 45000. This shows that 50% have Fail and 50% have succeeded at those ranges. This ranges are a gamble and if Louis fundraiser were run around this ranges, then perhaps is best to be avoided for the future. The highest percentage of successes is found at the smallest fundraiser goals. shrinking number of fundraisers start happening the higher the funding goals are, and we also began to see smaller percentages of success. Therefore, the width of the pattern we observe in the graph shrinks.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-Challenge and difficulties 1: hard to do contrast analysis not due to the data from kickstart, but by lack of Data from Louis. Since we don’t know when her launch date was, goal amount and even if she succeeded or not on her fundraiser. We can only do analysis on the data we currently have and provide basic suggestions. If we had more information on behalf of Louise we could take our analysis a step further and see how she can best position her camping to maximize the chances of her campaign being successful. 

--Challenge and difficulties 2: “live” status on the data present a challenge on their own. For our analysis we exclude them. Since we want to see only successful, fail and cancelled. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1: The best outcome is reached if the launch date happens in May
2: Most Fundraisers happen during the months of April and August.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1: The highest success rate is found at fundraiser goals of less than a 1000
2: Percentage of failure increases as the volume of outcomes increases.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1:Time spam, we didn’t calculated how long an event actually lasted.

2: location- we have location by country, but not by state or city.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1: we can create a table showing spam of time meaning, we already determine that month of May seems to be the best date to launch a fundraiser. We can see if time duration plays any roll in success. Because a long duration would be logical to achieve its goal, but what if is not. 

2: if we had more precise location, I believe we could pinpoint better if state or city rather than country has an impact if any at all to the success of any fundraiser.
